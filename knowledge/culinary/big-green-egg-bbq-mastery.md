## Smoking Techniques

### Wood Selection for Smoking
**Fruit Woods (Mild, Sweet)**:
- Apple: Mild, sweet flavor - great for pork and poultry
- Cherry: Sweet, fruity flavor - excellent for beef and pork
- Peach: Delicate, sweet flavor - perfect for poultry

**Nut Woods (Medium, Rich)**:
- Hickory: Strong, bacon-like flavor - classic for ribs and pork
- Pecan: Rich, nutty flavor - great for beef and poultry
- Oak: Mild, clean flavor - excellent for brisket

**Strong Woods (Bold, Intense)**:
- Mesquite: Powerful, earthy flavor - ideal for beef and lamb
- Walnut: Strong, slightly bitter - use sparingly

### Smoking Setup
**For Low & Slow (225°F - 250°F)**:
1. Install ConvEGGtor legs up (indirect heat)
2. Add 3-5 wood chunks around fire perimeter
3. Place drip pan with hot water on ConvEGGtor
4. Set cooking grid above drip pan
5. Maintain consistent temperature for entire cook

**Wood Usage Guidelines**:
- **Chips**: 2-3 handfuls for shorter cooks
- **Chunks**: 3-5 fist-sized pieces for long cooks
- **Placement**: Around fire perimeter, not in center
- **No Soaking**: Modern consensus is dry wood burns better

### Smoking Process
**Clean Smoke**: Wait for thin blue smoke before adding food
**Temperature Stability**: Maintain ±10°F of target temperature
**Moisture Management**: Use water pan for longer cooks
**Spritzing**: Apple juice or apple cider vinegar every 2 hours

## Grilling Techniques

### Direct Grilling Setup
**High Heat Searing (600°F+)**:
1. Remove ConvEGGtor
2. Open vents fully
3. Preheat 15-20 minutes
4. Clean and oil cooking grid
5. Sear 2-3 minutes per side

**Medium Heat Grilling (400°F-500°F)**:
1. Partially close vents
2. Use zone cooking (hot and cool sides)
3. Move food between zones as needed

### Reverse Searing Technique
1. Start with indirect heat at 275°F
2. Cook until internal temp is 10°F below target
3. Remove ConvEGGtor and open vents
4. Sear over direct heat 1-2 minutes per side
5. Perfect for thick steaks and chops

## Cooking Time Guidelines

### Smoking Times (at 225°F)
**Brisket**: 1.5 hours per pound (12-14 hours for 8-10 lb)
**Pork Shoulder**: 1.5-2 hours per pound (8-12 hours for 6-8 lb)
**Ribs**: 5-6 hours (baby back), 6-7 hours (spare ribs)

**Benefits**: Speeds cooking, prevents over-darkening
**Technique**: Wrap tightly, return to smoker until done

### Spatchcocking Poultry
**Process**: Remove backbone, flatten bird
**Benefits**: Faster cooking, more even temperature
**Technique**: Cook breast-side up at 375°F for 45-60 minutes

### Caveman/Cowboy Cooking
**Method**: Cook directly on hot coals

- Allows built-up heat to escape
- Prevents dangerous flashback

**Placement**: Keep EGG away from structures
- Minimum 3 feet from deck railings
- Never use indoors or under cover
- Ensure adequate ventilation

### Handling Safety
**Hot Surfaces**: Ceramic exterior gets extremely hot
- Don't place on wooden surfaces
- Use heat-resistant gloves
- Keep children and pets away

**Ash Management**: Clean ash regularly for proper airflow

**Process**: Remove old gasket, clean surface, apply new gasket
**Tip**: Replace during "clean burn" when old gasket melts

### Storage & Protection
**Covers**: Use heavy-duty, properly fitting cover
**Seasonal Storage**: Clean thoroughly, ensure complete dryness
**Winter Use**: EGG performs excellently in cold weather

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Temperature Problems
**Can't Reach High Temps**:
- Check for ash buildup restricting airflow
- Verify vents are fully open
- Ensure adequate fuel load

**Temperature Overshooting**:
- Close vents gradually
- Add more unlit charcoal to cool down
