# Bitcoin-Backed Loans and the Bitcoin-First Lifestyle

## Overview
Bitcoin-backed loans represent a revolutionary approach to liquidity that allows Bitcoin holders to access cash without selling their BTC. This strategy, popularized by companies like MicroStrategy and platforms like Strike, enables individuals and businesses to maintain their Bitcoin conviction while accessing necessary liquidity for operations and lifestyle.

## Re-hypothecation Risks and Considerations

### What is Re-hypothecation?
Re-hypothecation occurs when a platform sends customer collateral to another party to generate additional revenue. Each re-hypothecation layer increases risk exposure.

### Strike's Current Terms
- Single re-hypothecation is permitted to capital providers (e.g., NYDIG)
- Capital providers cannot further re-hypothecate the collateral
- No mandatory disclosure to borrowers about collateral placement

### Risk Assessment
- Higher risk due to lack of transparency in collateral handling
- No ability for users to assess counterparty risk
- Potential exposure to capital provider's financial health

### Recommended Solutions
- Implement tri-party custody arrangements
- Use Bitcoin-native multi-sig contracts between borrower, platform, and capital provider
- Require transparent disclosure of collateral placement
