# The 100K BTC Holders Thesis: Wealth Creation Through Bitcoin Adoption

## Executive Summary

The "100K BTC Holders" thesis posits that Bitcoin's path from $100,000 to $1,000,000 over the next 5-10 years will create approximately 100,000 new high-net-worth individuals (those with 10+ BTC). This represents one of the largest wealth creation events in human history.

## Mathematical Framework

### Historical Performance
- Bitcoin's historical compound annual growth rate: 44%
- Traditional assets average: 11% annually
- Mathematical certainty over speculation

### Price Trajectory Models
- **5-Year Path**: 48% CAGR to reach $1M by 2030
- **10-Year Path**: 26% CAGR to reach $1M by 2035
- Both scenarios require continued institutional adoption

### Current Distribution Analysis
At $100,000 per Bitcoin:
- Approximately 50,000-75,000 addresses hold 10+ BTC
- Less than 0.3 BTC per millionaire worldwide
- Global scarcity becoming mathematically apparent

## Bitcoin Freedom Mathematics

### The 6.15 BTC Threshold
With Bitcoin's historical 44% compound annual growth rate:
- 6.15+ BTC could enable financial freedom by 2025
- Based on $100K Bitcoin price and 44% growth projections
- Accounts for volatility and market cycles

### Wealth Distribution Impact
- 100,000 new high-net-worth individuals
- Each with $10M+ in Bitcoin holdings
