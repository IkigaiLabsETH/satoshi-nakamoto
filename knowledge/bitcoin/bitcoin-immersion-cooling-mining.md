# Bitcoin Immersion Cooling Mining Systems

## Overview: Immersion Is the New Fire

The future of Bitcoin mining is liquid. Across Europe and beyond, both industrial and at-home miners are abandoning traditional fan-based cooling in favor of silent, thermal-efficient immersion cooling systems. This isn't just about aesthetics—it's about survival in an increasingly competitive mining landscape where energy efficiency determines profitability.

## What Is Immersion-Cooled Mining?

Immersion mining involves submerging Bitcoin ASICs in non-conductive fluids (mineral oil or specialized engineered coolants) instead of air-cooling them with loud, power-hungry fans. The liquid absorbs heat directly from the hashboards, keeping chips cooler, quieter, and more stable.

### Key Benefits Over Air Cooling
