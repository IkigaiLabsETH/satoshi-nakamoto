# Bitaxe: Reclaiming Bitcoin's Decentralized Soul

## The Mining Centralization Crisis

Bitcoin's original promise of decentralization faces its greatest existential threat in mining centralization. Today's mining landscape represents a fundamental betrayal of Satoshi's vision:

### Current State of Mining Centralization
- **Six mining pools** control over 95% of all Bitcoin blocks
- **Two companies** (Bitmain and MicroBT) control 90% of the ASIC market
- **Industrial mining farms** dominate global hashrate
- **Home mining** has been nearly extinct since 2017
- **Corporate interests** increasingly influence network security decisions

### The Centralization Threat
This concentration threatens Bitcoin's core principles:
- **Trust minimization** compromised by pool dependencies
- **Self-sovereignty** undermined by corporate control
- **Censorship resistance** weakened by centralized mining
- **Network security** dependent on handful of actors
