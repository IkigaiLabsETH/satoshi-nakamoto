# VanEck NODE ETF: Onchain Economy Investment Strategy

## Overview
The VanEck Onchain Economy ETF (NYSE: NODE) represents a strategic investment approach to the emerging onchain economy. Rather than direct cryptocurrency exposure, NODE provides equity-based access to companies building, enabling, or leveraging blockchain infrastructure.

- **Decentralized computing**: Storage and finance protocols

### Key Capabilities
