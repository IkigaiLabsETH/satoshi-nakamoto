### June 2025 Market Correction
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Impact:** 70% stock decline  
**Cause:** Confusion over regulatory S-3 filing  

The market correction was triggered by misinterpretation of standard post-PIPE procedures rather than the company's Ethereum treasury strategy itself.

## Regulatory Clarification

### S-3 Filing Confusion
Joseph Lubin's clarification statement:

> "Some are misinterpreting SBET's S-3 filing: It registers shares for potential resale by prior investors. The 'Shares Owned After the Offering' column is hypothetical, assuming full sale of registered shares. This is standard post-PIPE procedure in tradfi, not an indication of actual sales. To clarify, neither Consensys nor I have sold any shares."

### Key Points
- **S-3 Filing:** Routine procedure following private placements
- **Share Registration:** For potential resale, not immediate insider sales
