# Gold vs Bitcoin: Hard Money Analysis in the Digital Age

## Overview
Gold and bitcoin both serve as hard money assets - investments that hold intrinsic value and resist debasement by central authorities. This analysis examines their performance since 2020, characteristics as store of value assets, and implications for investors navigating debt cycles and fiat currency debasement.

## Key Findings
- **Bitcoin Performance**: Up 808% since August 2020 (from $11,720 to $106,418.98)
- **Gold Performance**: Up 65% since August 2020 (from $2,067.15 to $3,369.95)
- **Long-term US Treasuries**: Down 42% since 2020, indicating a shift away from traditional safe havens
- **COVID Panic Buyers**: Bitcoin investors who bought during March 2020 panic are up 1,884%

## Hard Money Asset Characteristics Comparison

### Gold vs Bitcoin Attributes

| Attribute | Gold | Bitcoin |
|-----------|------|---------|
| **Scarcity** | Scarce, but supply can increase through mining (no fixed limit) | Fixed supply of 21 million coins, absolutely scarce |
| **Durability** | Does not corrode, lasts indefinitely as physical asset | Digital, exists as long as blockchain network operates |
| **Portability** | Heavy and cumbersome for large quantities | Digital, instant worldwide transfer via internet |
| **Divisibility** | Can be divided, but physical division is cumbersome | Highly divisible into satoshis (100 million per bitcoin) |
| **Fungibility** | All gold is identical, fully fungible | All bitcoins identical, though "tainted coins" can affect fungibility |
| **Acceptability** | Widely accepted globally for thousands of years | Gaining acceptance, but not yet as widespread as gold |
| **Volatility** | Less volatile, smaller price swings, conservative friendly | Highly volatile, large price swings, higher risk |
| **Regulatory Risk** | Generally not subject to regulatory risk as physical asset | Subject to regulatory risk, potential government restrictions |
| **Industrial Uses** | Used in electronics, dentistry, adds intrinsic value | No industrial uses, value purely as digital asset |
| **Network Effect** | Value not dependent on network, intrinsic to metal | Value increases with more users, enhancing utility |
| **Energy Consumption** | Mining requires energy, less discussed than bitcoin | Mining is energy-intensive, raises environmental concerns |
| **Censorship Resistance** | Physical gold can be confiscated by authorities | Can be held in self-custody, resistant to censorship |

## Debt Cycle Context

### The Inevitable Conclusion
The analysis suggests we're approaching the end of a major debt cycle, characterized by:

- Sophisticated investors identified this shift in 2020
- Performance data validates this early recognition
- Bitcoin hodlers emerged as best-performing investors of 2010s-2020s
