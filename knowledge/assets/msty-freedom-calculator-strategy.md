# MSTY Freedom Calculator & Financial Freedom Strategy

## Overview
The MSTY Freedom Calculator is a comprehensive tool designed to help individuals calculate their path to financial freedom using MSTY (YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF) as a core income-generating asset. This strategy focuses on creating sustainable monthly income while building long-term wealth through strategic allocation across different asset classes.

## Core Calculation Parameters

### Key Inputs
- **Monthly Income Goal**: Target monthly income needed for financial freedom
- **MSTY Price/Share**: Current market price per MSTY share
- **Monthly Dividend/Share**: Monthly dividend payment per MSTY share
- **USD/EUR Exchange Rate**: For international investors dealing with currency conversion

### Example Calculation (Based on $1,000 Monthly Goal)
- **Shares Needed**: 1,000 shares
- **Total Investment Required**: $20,000
- **BTC Equivalent**: ~0.24 BTC

## Tax Implications

### International Tax Structure
For European investors, the tax framework includes:
- **Gross Yearly Income**: $12,000 (based on $1,000/month)
- **US Withholding Tax**: 15% ($1,800)
- **European Tax**: 15% ($1,800)
- **Net Income in EUR**: â‚¬7,728

This dual taxation structure is important for international investors to understand when calculating actual take-home income.

## Strategic Portfolio Allocation

### Recommended $200,000 Portfolio Structure
1. **MSTY (Income Generation)**: $20,000 (10%)
   - Primary income source
   - Monthly dividend payments
   - Covers living expenses

2. **BTC (Savings/Store of Value)**: $160,000 (80%)
   - Long-term wealth preservation
   - Hard money accumulation
   - Tax-deferred growth

3. **MSTR (Growth/Leverage)**: $20,000 (10%)
   - Bitcoin exposure with corporate leverage
   - Growth potential
   - Complementary to direct BTC holdings

## Core Philosophy: "Live Life Strategy"

### The YieldMax Approach
> "Live Life off MSTY distributions and let MSTR & BTC stack over time, tax-deferred (not in EUR). You're cashflow-rich, compounding hard money, and never touching the principal."

This strategy emphasizes:
- **Cash Flow Rich**: Immediate income needs met through MSTY distributions
- **Compounding Hard Money**: BTC and MSTR growth over time
- **Principal Preservation**: Never touching the core investment base
