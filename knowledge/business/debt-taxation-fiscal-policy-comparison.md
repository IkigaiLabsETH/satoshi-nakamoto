# Debt & Taxation: Comparing Fiscal Policies Across Continents

## Executive Summary

The comparison of national debt and taxation between Europe and the United States reveals significant differences in fiscal policy and economic structures. These differences reflect varying approaches to public services, social welfare, and economic management. In this landscape, AI and Bitcoin emerge as potential tools for personal and national economic strategies.
